# Scene class

The `Scene` class is at the core of `brainrender`. Most of your interactions with `brainrender` will have to do with using `Scene` to add elements to your rendering. 

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an overview of what `Scene` does and how to use it. For more details check the [automatically generated docs](../autogenerated-docs/brainrender/scene.md)!
{% endhint %}

 

When creating an instance of `Scene` for the first time, you have the opportunity to specify several parameters that will determine what your `scene` looks like and what kind of data you will be able to add to it.
