# Getting in touch

The best way to get in touch is on GitHub. If you head over to the `brainrender` [repository](https://github.com/BrancoLab/BrainRender) you can find more **docs**, **examples** and everything else you might need. 

You can also open an **issue** to ask a question about `brainrender`, to request a new **feature** or to report a **bug**. If you'd like to help develop code for `brainrender` you can fork the repository and submit a **pull request** with the changes you'd like to propose. 

You can also find the main developer behind `brainrender` on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Federico_claudi) if you'd like to reach out there.
