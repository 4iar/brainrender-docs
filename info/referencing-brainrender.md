# Referencing brainrender

`brainrender` was first released with an accompanying [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961748v1). While a lot has changed for `brainrender` since then, the preprint is still the best way to reference `brainrender`'s contribution whenever you use the software in your work. 



Please **cite the preprint** as:
